/*
Every time it loops through a number, it should print "The number is # and " and a specific message on a line in the DOM.

The specific messages should state
If the number is below 0
If the number is greater than 50
If the number equals 14

When I click on one of the lines, it should increase the value by 1, with the message staying as it was

In the end, I should see six different lines, each one containing a message letting me know what the number is. 

None of the numbers should have multiple messages
